## Set Up Docker For Mac with Native NFS
The default file system that Docker uses is quite slow in the Mac environment, for that reason, many devâ€™s used NFS.

Setup native NFS for Docker:
```bash
./vendor/baijunyao/laravel-docker-compose/bin/setup_native_nfs_docker_osx.sh
```

Use docker-compose-nfs.yml
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-nfs.yml up
```
